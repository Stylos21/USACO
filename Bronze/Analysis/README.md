# Analysis Submissions for December 2020 Bronze Division
Please keep in mind these are not solutions submitted during the contest, rather this was after the contest ended.

During the contest, I only got 6 / 10 (inculdes sample case) for the first problem, Do You Know Your ABCs?, and I only got 1 / 10 (the sample case) for Daisy Chains. I was unable to submit the third problem
